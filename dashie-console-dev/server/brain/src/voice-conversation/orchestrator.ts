// Build plan §12. Adapted for the brain (surface-agnostic):
//   - NO NLP fast-path (caller/surface-specific).
//   - NO HA entity FETCH — entities arrive via provided_context.ha_entities.
//   - NO action dispatch — the brain RETURNS the action; the caller executes it.
//   - Logging/deduction uses the account JWT (per pass), via database-operations.

// NO Supabase imports — runtime coupling lives only in the injectable OrchestratorIO adapters.
// See README "Dual-runtime sync contract" + build plan §13.16. Re-authoring this as a Node copy is
// the forbidden move (recreates the §1 drift).

// here and provided at call time via OrchestratorIO. Deno wires them in default-io.ts; the Node
// add-on wires its own. Keep it this way — see README "Dual-runtime sync contract" + §13.16.

/**
 * What the TEMPLATE can actually answer: a score, a result, or a fixture (when/where/who's
 * playing). That is the whole of `templateSports` — finalLine / liveLine / scheduledLine.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-16 field bug). The gate used to be "template unless the text matches
 * GAME_DETAIL_RE", i.e. the template was the DEFAULT and caught everything unrecognised. But the
 * template has no "I don't know" branch — given a game, it describes the fixture, whatever it was
 * asked. So a roster question fell through and got the schedule read at it, every time:
 *
 *   "Who's starting at Striker for Spain?"  → "Spain play Argentina, Sun, Jul 19."   (×3, verbatim)
 *
 * The data has no rosters/line-ups/stats/standings, so no wording of the template could have
 * answered it. Inverting the default fixes the CLASS: template only when we recognise a
 * score/schedule ask; anything else goes to the model, which can at least say it doesn't have that.
 *
 * The asymmetry is the argument: a miss toward the MODEL costs one call and still answers
 * correctly (and on a local/BYOK brain costs nothing at all); a miss toward the TEMPLATE hands the
 * user a confidently wrong answer forever. Fail toward the component that can admit ignorance.
 *
 * Deterministic and model-independent → unit-testable with no model (see sports-depth.test.ts,
 * same rationale as game-depth.test.ts).
