// ha-devices-block.ts — tell PASS 1 which smart-home devices and rooms this home has.
//
// WHY (Thread VH s6, 2026-10-02; John: "yes - let's do that"). Pass 1 decides the route and has
// never seen the home's entity list — only the home_assistant pass 2 does. With pass-1 thinking OFF
// (orchestrator.ts:859, shipped 20260717 for latency), Gemini answered "is the back door locked" /
// "what's the office temperature" from its own knowledge instead of routing: provider-direct on
// the deployed prompt, 30/32 direct (tools/voice-bench/h2h-inpractice/thinking-vs-temp-diagnostic.ts).
// Adding this block, thinking still off: HA questions routed 102/104 (was 70/104), and general
// questions that merely mention a device word stayed off home control 0/48 — pass1-names.ts,
// results/pass1-names-s6.txt. The block text and its position (immediately before the CRITICAL
// line) are EXACTLY what that probe measured; change either and re-measure.
//
// 📌 Server-side constant, not a js/ai/prompts .md, on the same reasoning as the sports/calendar
// blocks in prompt.ts: the .md sources regenerate into the console repos, and this block is
// data-driven per turn anyway. Aliases are listed only when the entity HAS them, so the bench
// household (no aliases) renders byte-identically to the measured arm.
//
// Pure + dual-runtime (Deno edge + Node add-on): no Deno.*, no imports beyond types.
